The program should be able to run if you follow our instruction.
If failed to run, please make sure that the firewall rules are not block our port.
In our program, we use many irregular network port to connect outside network such as 3000, 4000, 3306, 9443, etc.
If your firewall only allow regular tcp / udp  port may block the access.


Besides network, it may also due to compile or download problem during npm install
You may also try npm install again, or try npm build or npm rebuild to fix the problem

Please be remind to open both client (npm start) and back-end server ("cd server" then type "node index.js")

Please do not close any windows and command prompt as it will stop the server and services.
